# TerminalResume

Ideally the goal for this project is to spend some time learning angular and building myself a resume I can eventually update. It would be really ideal to display a subset of commands and allow users to view different commands overall display a bunch of different content relating to my technical experience.

For Example:
- help
    - Displays all commands that can be run on this project
- college
    - Displays all relevant information about my college experience
    - Include senior project ect.
- work
    - Cycles through all form's of prominent experience
- languages
    - Displays all relevant languages used
- cloud
    - Displays all relevant cloud engineering experinece
- tooling
    - Displays all relevant tooling and framworks I've used
- joke 
    - Displays random joke fetch from some joke api 
- quit
    - I don't think we can make and exit call to the dom but this would be cool
- default
    - result returned when we're not really sure what should've happened cause well, we don't get the command you asked

Overall to remind myself, don't try to make it look pretty day one, just make it work and worry about styling component by component later
